###### Wear My Closet is a web application designed for virtual closet sharing among friends in an effort to reduce material consumption and extend the life span of our clothes. I came up with a virtual way to loan and/or borrow items in your own closet by using python as the main backend language and javascript to amplify the front end experience.

### My Community
A user can be a member of several communities so they first select the one they'd like to view. Upon selection all items from all members of the community will load onto the page. A user will be able to see what items are available to borrow or unavailable according to the item status and the 'Add to Cart' button disabled. If they select an item to add to their cart an alert will confirm. They can continue to browse or move their cart.

### My Closet
This is a user's item inventory. They can check in items that have been returned and can also upload new items to their closet through Cloudinary.

### My Cart
To complete the checkout process a user selects their return date or removes the item. Once they submit their order the order summary appears and a text notification is sent to the item owner to initiate the exchange.
